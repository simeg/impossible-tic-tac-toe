# impossible-tic-tac-toe [![Build Status][build_badge]][build_status]

Ever felt like a tic tac toe (also called _Noughts and Crosses_) God? Then I
challenge you to [beat my bot](https://impossible-tic-tac-toe.herokuapp.com/).

Built with Rust and WebAssembly. If you're interested in learning more about
Rust + WebAssembly I recommend these resources:
* [Rust ðŸ¦€ and WebAssembly ðŸ•¸ book](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html)
* [`wasm-pack-template`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack-template) to quickly get you started
